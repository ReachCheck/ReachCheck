# Get Summaries

**asmCallGraph.jar** is used to generate call edge information for third-party library JAR files, which is used for reachability analysis. The usage is as follows:
`java -jar asmCallGraph.jar -jarFile <jarFilePath> -output <outputDir>`

The **src** directory contains python code files that get the summaries.
